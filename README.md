# üß† Machine Learning

This repository is a concise, hands-on recap of popular Machine Learning algorithms across three paradigms: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning. It focuses on practical intuition, minimal theory, and runnable demos.

## üéØ Scope
- Supervised: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Naive Bayes
- Unsupervised: K-Means (and extensions later)
- Reinforcement: Basic introduction and simple demo (planned)

- For each algorithm, I will aim to cover
    * Brief theory: core idea and objective function
    * Suitable data/types: regression vs classification, numeric vs categorical, assumptions
    * Math essentials: key formulas and constraints (high-level)
    * Pros/Cons: when to use and when to avoid
    * Fine-tuning: important hyperparameters and how to select them
    * Data requirements: preprocessing/encoding/scaling needed
    * Demo: an example of a small set of data to practice and verify understanding, performed on Jupyter Notebook (file .ipynb) to easily learn and understand each cell of algorithm

Note: I use established libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, ...) for model training/inference and focus on usage and understanding. I do not re-implement algorithms from scratch here. If you want high-quality from-scratch NumPy implementations for learning, see: https://github.com/eriklindernoren/ML-From-Scratch/tree/master/mlfromscratch

## ‚öñÔ∏è Evaluation and Optimization
- Metrics: MSE/RMSE/MAE, R¬≤, Accuracy, Precision/Recall/F1, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix, Silhouette (unsupervised), etc.
- Model selection: train/validation/test split, cross-validation
- Optimization: Gradient Descent/SGD, Momentum, Adam, regularization (L1/L2), early stopping, feature engineering/selection

## üöÄ Getting Started
- Open notebooks in `Supervised_Learning/` to explore each algorithm.
- Run cells top-to-bottom; each notebook is self-contained with preprocessing and evaluation.
- Extend demos with your own datasets by following the preprocessing guidance per algorithm.

## üñ•Ô∏è Streamlit Apps (Interactive UI)
- Plan to add simple Streamlit apps for each algorithm to demo interactive prediction and visualization.
- Each app will load a trained model (or pipeline), expose inputs via sidebar widgets, and render predictions/plots.
- Expected location: `apps/<algorithm>/app.py`. Example run: `streamlit run apps/linear_regression/app.py`.
